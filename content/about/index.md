I am a **Geoinformatics fellow** with NASA DEVELOP. DEVELOP is part of NASA Earth science program, under the Applied science and the Capacity building programs. I provide remote sensing and GIS technical support to *~70 project teams a year* as well as help facilitate any code or software release. DEVELOP projects apply Earth observations to the application areas of Agriculture & Food Security, Disasters, Ecological Forecasting, Energy, Health and Air Quality, Urban Development, Transportation & Infrastructure and Water Resources.
